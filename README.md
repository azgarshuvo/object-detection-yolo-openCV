## Download YOLO config and weights file

Given the below link you will find several version of YOLO. Select a version and download the weights as well as the cfg file and place it into the **yolo-config** directory. 
* For faster processing you may download the YOLOv3-tiny 
* For better accuracy you may download other version-3 configuration file
* Here I have used YOLOv3-320
